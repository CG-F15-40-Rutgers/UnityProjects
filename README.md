###B1: Navigation and Animation
1. An interactive Unity Project that demonstrates both Unity's NavMesh feature and animation abilities.

2. In this project, we focused on creating animated objects with the ability to navigate around a maze field.
In Part 1, you will notice a complex field in which there are multiple levels - including floating platforms, bridges, and stairs.  You will also see a crowd of agents; each of which can be selected and navigated across multiple levels with our user provided input. In our environment, we have also included two types of obstacles - stationary, dynamic and Nazgul. Keep away from the Nazgul obstacles!!!
In Part 2, we have simulated Robot Kyle, an animated character that can be controlled with different states (walk/jump/run), through the keyboard
Part 3 combines our first two videos into a clean, final demonstration. You will observe Robot Kyle has now duplicated and become part of the crowd simulator. These new animated characters can all move around with user inputs. Pressing "o" will allow the agents to walk and pressing "p" will allow the agents to run.

3. Choose the path you want the agents to follow and watch as they intelligently find their way across the map!
